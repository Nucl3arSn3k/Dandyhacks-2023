    Evaluating Information
    • Popularity =/= quality.
    • Usually Higher Quality:
    • Information taken independently from many
    diverse individuals is often reliable.
    • Usually Lower Quality:
    • Information taken from like-minded sources.
    • Information taken from sources that already
    consumed an earlier source.
    • Neutrals → swayed, or silenced
    • Partisans → pushing existing views further
